        <p>If I dont say this now I will surely break As Im leaving the one I want to take Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait My heart has started to separate Oh oh oh Be my baby Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Ill look after you There now steady love so few come and dont go Will you wont you be the one I always know When Im losing my control the city spins around Youre the only one who knows you slow it down Oh oh oh Be my baby Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Ill look after you If ever there was a doubt My love she leans into me This most assuredly counts She says most assuredly Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Be my baby Ill look after you Its always have and never hold Youve begun to feel like home Whats mine is yours to leave or take Whats mine is yours to make your own Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Be my baby Oh oh oh</p>
